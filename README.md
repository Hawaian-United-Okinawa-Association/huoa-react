## Scope

The objective is to redesign the current website for HUOA to give the association a fresh, modern look that will also run on some of today's latest technologies.

## Getting started
- Create an `.env` file in the main directory and add `NODE_PATH=src/` this will handle our absolute paths

#### Installation
- use `npm install` to install dependencies
- use `npm ci` to use `package-lock.json`'s versioning

#### Production (WIP)
- `npm run build` compiles and optimizes react
- `npm run server` to run in `Production`

**Note** Nodemon is installed thus running server you will have a reloading state of the server

##### For testing coverage reporting
- use `npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false`
